# Turtle Race

## Overview
This Python script simulates a race between turtles using the Turtle graphics library. Users can place bets on the winning turtle's color, and the program will determine the winner based on random movements of the turtles.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Turtle (`pip install PythonTurtle`)

## Usage
1. Run the Python script `turtle_race.py`.
2. A window will open displaying six turtles of different colors at the starting line.
3. Enter your bet on the winning turtle's color when prompted.
4. The turtles will start moving randomly across the screen.
5. Once a turtle crosses the finish line, the race will stop, and the winner will be announced.
6. The program will compare the winning turtle's color with your bet and print the result.

## Notes
- Adjust the number of turtles, their colors, and starting positions as needed.
- Customize the winning conditions and user interaction according to your preferences.
